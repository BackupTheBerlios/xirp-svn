<b>&#967;irp Report Search</b><br/><br/>

All generated reports in &#967;irp are saved locally as PDF document in the reports folder and
additionally in the existing database as backup. To find an older report in the database use the
report search dialog. The dialog can be invoked using the menu <code>Reports -> Report search</code>, or
the corresponding menu entry in the tray icon context menu.
<br/><br/>
You can search reports by specifying a time interval and choosing a robot fromm the drop-down menu.
It is not nessessary to specify the time or to choose a robot. If you only specify the time interval, reports
for every robot int he database are found. If you do not specify a time interval and choose a robot, all
reports for this robot are found. Finally if you do not choose a robot and do not specify a time interval all
reoprts for all robots are found.
<br/><br/>
Below you can see the dialog. If you found the report of your interest you may want to open the PDF or print it 
directly. This can be done by clicking the <code>Print report</code> and <code>Open report</code> buttons.
