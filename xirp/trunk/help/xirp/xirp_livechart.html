The live charting allows the user to view the elaboration of the value of one or 
more selected sensor keys. Before you can plot one or more of the sensor values
you have to select the desired one from the drop-down menu. Therefore just click 
on the green plus icon.

As you can see there are two additional tool items available. The red <code>A</code> indicates
that the live charting is in the absolute time mode. By clicking on the item it can be switch to 
relative time mode and back. This can be done before and while plotting. The green triangle starts 
the plotting and turns into a stop icon, so you can stop the plotting by clicking on the same button 
again.
<br/><br/>
After you have chosen one or more keys to plot you can start the plotting. If you are not connected
to a robot, or have not received any values yet, the plot will look like the one below.

When you are connected to a robot and receive sensor values from it, you can see the live charting 
in action. It may look like seen in the screenshot below.

If you selected options in the preferences dialog to automatically export the 
charts (see chapter about the preferences for details) the files are generated
after stopping the plotting.
