<b>&#967;irp Workspace</b><br/><br/>

&#967;irp offers a customizable and on-the-fly translatable graphical user interface. The
workspace can be devided in the 5 following parts.

<ul>
	<li><p align="left">Menu and tool bars</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Status bar and tray</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Workbench</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Included panels</p></li>
</ul>

Before we take a closer look at the parts mentioned above, we look at the workspace at a whole.

The picture above shows a possible arrangement of the plugins and internal panels.
Panels that are created, because of loaded plugins are marked blue. Red marked panels are
internal ones and the yellow marked spots are mixed plugin-created and internal, menus and tool bars.
<br/><br/>

<b>Menu and tool bars</b><br/><br/>
The menu is devided into eight sub-menus: <img src="./images/menu.png"/>
<br/><br/>

The <code>File</code> menu contains entrys for opening the profile, robot and communication specification
editors. The menu also contains entrys for the preferences dialog and for closing the application.
<br/><br/>
The <code>View</code> menu contains entrys for showing or hiding the status and tool bar. It also has an entrys
which locks the tools on the tool bar, so they can't be moved to a custom order. At last the menu contains entrys
for showing or hiding the internal panels, f.e. the live chart panel.
<br/><br/>
The <code>Robots</code> menu contains sub-menus for each loaded profile. These sub-menus contain entrys
for each robot assocciated with the profile. These entrys show or hide the complete robot tab in the 
workbench area.
<br/><br/>
The <code>Plugins</code> menu is a context sensitive menu. It contains the non-report, non-embedded plugins for the 
currently active robot. It also contains an entry for opening the preferences dialog.
<br/><br/>
The <code>Reports</code> menu is a context sensitive menu. It contains the report plugins for the currently
active robot and an entry for opening the report search.
<br/><br/>
The <code>Extras</code> menu contains entrys for opening the mail client, the contact management, the chart generator and
the TesterBot user interface.
<br/><br/>
The <code>External tools</code> menu is a context sensitive menu, which contains the user-defined external tools for the
currently active profile.
<br/><br/>
The <code>?</code> menu contains entrys for showing the info, plugin info and help dialogs.
<br/><br/>

There are two tool bars available. The application tool bar makes several functions available as tool items.
The most important functions are made availabe over the tool bar. As an additional feature there is a timer.
You may start, pause and stop the timer and can see the elapsed time in the robot toolbar. The start, stop and pause
tool items in the application tool bar controls all timers of all robots. The application can also hold tool items created by
a plugin.

<br/><br/>

The robot tool bar is alsomst completely driven by plugins. The first drop-down menu holds the entrys of communication
interface plugins, the second one holds the protocol plugins available for the robot. You have to choose one of each
to connect to a robot. This can be done by clicking the plug tool item left of the drop-down menus. The robot toolbar has
the timer display and controls for the timer of this robot. Also the tool bar can hold items created by a plugin.

<b>Status bar and tray</b><br/><br/>
The status bar shows information about the current active robot, the connections status, the data traffic and the 
status of the power sources of the robot. Only one power source status can be shown. If a robot has more than one power
source, the first one is shown by default. The following power sources can be made visible by right-clicking on the battery icon
in the bottom right corner. The desired power source can be chosen from the opening menu.

<b>Included panels</b><br/><br/>
There are four included panels which are not created by a plugin.
<br/><br/>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left">System log</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Live charting</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Recorder</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Robot overview</p></li>
</ul>	
<br/><br/>
The <strong>System log</strong> shows log messages created by the Log4J logging system.
With the <strong>Live charting</strong> panel a real time plotting of received sensor values is possible.
The <strong>Recorder</strong> can record the received vaules of selected sensors to the database.
Finally the <strong>Robot overview</strong> shows an abstract view of the robot with the attached sensors.
