The mail manager will contain sent and unsent mails. Unsent mails occur when something went wrong
with the transportation of the mail. To avoid data loss, those mails are saved as unsent.

are shown on the right hand side and the text on the bottom of the dialog. The table above the
mail text area shows information about the send status, send date, subject and the first
