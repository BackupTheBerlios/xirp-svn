<b>&#967;irp Comm-Spec files</b><br/><br/>

In &#967;irp every robot must specify a commucation specification. These specifications are 
defined in <code>*.cms</code> files which are located in <code>/conf/profiles/commspecs</code>.
These files specify the communication interface and protocol plugins that are available for a 
robot. The possible robot handler plugin is also specified in these files.
<br/><br/>
Use the communication specification editor to edit or create new comm-spec files.
