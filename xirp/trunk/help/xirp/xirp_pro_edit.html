The edit dialog is the same dialog as the create-new dialog, so we only take a look 
at creating a new profile. At first you have to provide a name for the profile.

Next you must choose one or more robots for this profile. To do so click on the button <code>Add robot</code> and
choose one or more robot files. You can add the same robot more than once by adding it again and again using the robot chooser
dialog.

After you have added the robots you wanted you can see that the dot in the upper right corner went from red to green to indicate
that all nessessary information was provided.
