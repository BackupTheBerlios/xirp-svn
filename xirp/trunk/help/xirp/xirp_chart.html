<b>&#967;irp Charts</b><br/><br/>

In &#967;irp it is possible to generate several different chart-types. The data on which the charts are generated upon
is gathered by the recording feature of &#967;irp, or is directly plotted into a chart by the live-chart feature. 
Read more about this topics in the corresponding chapters. This chapter deals with the generation of
charts from existing records.
<br/><br/>
Charts from existing records are generated using the <code>Create chart</code> dialog. The dialog is available
under the menu entry <code>Extras -> Charts</code>.

</center>
<br/><br/>

There are four possible chart types available. You can choose the from the chart type drop-down menu.
<br/><br/>
<ul>
	<li><p align="left">Time chart<br/>This type shows the values as line chart.</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Pie chart<br/>This type shows the occurences of keys in the time interval.</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Bar chart<br/>This type chart shows the values als bars.</p></li>
	<li><p align="left">Scatter chart<br/>This type shows the values as points.</p></li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>

Before you can choose a record you have to select one of the robots. This can be done from the
robot name drop-down menu.

<br/><br/>

</center>
<br/><br/>

After that you can choose one or more records for this robot, using the record lookup dialog.
If you want only one record to be the data for the chart leave <code>Compare multiple records</code> unchecked.
But if you want up to four records to be compared check <code>Compare multiple records</code>.
If this flag is set you can select more than one record from the record lookup dialog.

<br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="./images/chart_robot.png"/>
</center>
<br/><br/>

The record lookup dialog shows you all available recordings for the selected robot.

<br/><br/>

</center>
<br/><br/>

<b>One record</b><br/><br/>

After you have chosen a record you can see the observed keys of this record in the list 
on the right hand side. You must select at least one of the observed keys. (Learn more about 
observed keys in the recordings chapter.) In the middle of the dialog you find the time interval
area. You can choose the interval to look at by moving the two time separators of the time interval widget.

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

Before generating the chart you have the possibility to activate some options.
You can choose to have a chart generated with relative time values. <code>Use all keys</code>
selects all availabe observed keys in the record. <code>Show threshold</code> activates the 
threshold input field, where you can specify the value where a threshold line is drawn in the chart.
The <code>Create 3D chart</code> option is not availabe for all chart types. The last four options are export options,
if enabled the chart is exported automatically while after creation. The exports are saved under
<code>charts/&lt;robot name&gt;/&lt;export format extension&gt;</code>.

<br/><br/>

</center>
<br/><br/>

After clicking <code>Generate chart</code> the chart is openend in the generated chart dialog and 
may look like the one seen below. The chart dialog has several options in its context menu and the
ability to zoom into the chart by selecting an area with the mouse.

<br/><br/>

<b>Multiple records</b><br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

If you choose to compare up to four records you have to check <code>Compare multipe records</code>. 
Then you select up to four records form with the record lookup dialog. On the right hand side you can see
the observed keys which have all the selected records in common. Also the time interval area has
an additional option, the <code>Time interval</code> value in milliseconds. This value is the amount of milliseconds
to look at in the selected records. The interval can only be as large as the shortest record. The sliders in the
time interval widget now only can be moved togerther int the chosen interval.

The generated chart of multiple records may look like the one below.
