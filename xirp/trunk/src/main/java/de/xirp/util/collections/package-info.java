/**
 * Extended collections from the java.util package.<br/> 
 * <br/>	
 * This package provides some more collections, like a Bidirectional
 * 	Hash Map and a Multi Value Hashmap.<br/>
 * <br/>	
 * The Bidirectional Hashmap allows access from key to value and vice versa.<br/>
 * <br/>	
 * The Multi Value Hashmap allows more than one value per key (and has a version for
 * concurrent access for multithreading)<br/>
